internal folder is a special type of folder in GO, it enforces the code that, other teams cannot import its code.
For example you've made a data structure or dependecies you're using in your code but if some one imported that code,
and you dont know about it because its not intendent to be imported, so they are dependent on that code, and in future if you change in that code 
they dont know because its used for your code, their code also get crash or break because its not made for them.
